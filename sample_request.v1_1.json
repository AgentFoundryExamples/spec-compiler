    "must": [
      "Add reusable texture, normal, and halo assets plus shading tweaks for planets, moons, and stars",
      "Update rendering components to apply consistent lighting, rotation cues, and faint glow borders tied to theme colors",
      "Extend admin editors to manage theme presets (planet type, lunar traits, star halo intensity) persisted through universe data services",
      "Document art direction guidelines and workflow updates for configuring celestial themes"

    "dont": [
      "Do not reposition celestial objects; limit changes to styling, shading, and metadata",

      "Support high-DPI/mobile devices with maintained performance",
      "Provide texture import failure degradation with placeholder shading",

    "assumptions": [
      "Existing planets, moons, and stars look placeholder and lack customization",
      "Large textures can bloat bundle sizes or drop frame rates if not compressed",
      "Missing or legacy theme data will need fallback to default presets"
